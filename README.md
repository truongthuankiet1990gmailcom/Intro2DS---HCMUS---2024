## Project Overview:
This repository contains our team's final project for the Introduction to Data Science course. Our project involves analyzing movie data to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models. We have applied various data science techniques including EDA, data preprocessing, questions and analysis, feature selection, model preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to movies. The data is collected from multiple sources and includes the following columns:

- **Title**: The title of the movie
- **CriticScore**: The critic score of the movie
- **UserScore**: The user score of the movie
- **Link**: The link to the movie's page
- **PlatformReleased**: The platform where the movie was released
- **Cast**: The cast of the movie
- **Director**: The director of the movie
- **Genre**: The genre of the movie
- **Rating**: The rating of the movie
- **Runtime**: The runtime of the movie
- **Studio**: The studio that produced the movie
- **Release Date**: The release date of the movie
- **Production Budget**: The production budget of the movie
- **Domestic Gross**: The domestic gross revenue of the movie
- **Worldwide Gross**: The worldwide gross revenue of the movie

## Purpose:
This dataset can be used for a variety of analyses:

- **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features (e.g., cast, director, genre) that contribute to the movie's success.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict movie revenue.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to understand the relationships between different features.

## Potential Analyses Include:
- Investigating the impact of different features on movie revenue.
- Performing exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns in movie data.

- **Questions/**: Contains questions and analysis related to the project.
- **Reflection/**: Contains reflections and learnings from the project.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NhatHuyDuong/Intro2DS-HCMUS-2024.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Intro2DS-HCMUS-2024
    ```
3. Choose the appropriate kernel.

## Usage:
- To run the notebooks:
    + Open the notebook in Jupyter and press `Run All`.
    + If there are some libraries not included in your kernel, please run the command prompt and write `pip install required-library`.

## Project Management:
- We are using Microsoft Planner for project management. You can track our progress and view our backlog on our [Microsoft Planner](https://planner.cloud.microsoft/webui/plan/CPAR6teeCE-pZBMR6o_p-sgAEG6v?tid=40127cd4-45f3-49a3-b05d-315a43a9f033).
